        <h2><span class="underline-blue">Development and Design</span></h2>
        <p>I have always been a creator and tinkerer, fascinated by how things work.  At an early age, I taught myself how to use a computer and started building websites for fun.  The satisfaction of getting something to work and then publishing it to the internet was something I really enjoyed.  My early websites, I'm talking the old Angelfire and Geocities days, were built with a combination of Dreamcatcher and Flash.  I needed graphics, so I taught myself how to use Photoshop and Fireworks. I guess I didn't realize that I could turn this all into a career so I instead went to college and earned a Finance degree.</p>
        <p>Fast forward 7 years after college, I realized I still really enjoyed web development and started to learn programming in Javascript and Ruby.  That's when I began my career change journey and enrolled in a part-time frontend development course at General Assembly, then went back for the Web Development Immersive program.  I have taken what I call a "blast cannon" approach to learning web development, in that I have learned a good bit about several different development technologies.</p>

        <h2><span class="underline-blue">Creative Problem Solving</span></h2>
        <p>In order to be a good programmer, it's given that you need to be a great problem solver.  I personally lend my problem solving skill development to playing video games as a child.  The best example I can give is playing Zelda: Ocarina of Time.  This game always comes to mind when thinking about problem solving, because throughout the game you are faced with obstacles and puzzles which you need to solve in order to save the princess.  Solving these puzzles were no easy task and this was before the says of being able to go to YouTube and watch someone beat a boss or level.  </p>
        <p>What I particularly enjoy is coming up with solutions that improve existing solutions, also known as refactoring in programming.  I also believe in not overcomplicating solutions so that they are easy to understand from another person's perspective.  Lastly, I have a passion for automating manual tasks.  If there is some repetitive task that is completed on an ongoing basis, I always like to find ways to make completing that task easier or having something complete it for you. </p>

        <h2><span class="underline-blue">Responsiveness and Communication</span></h2>
        <p>I have a strong background of customer service related work experience.  I always like to make sure clients are satisfied, both with the final product and during the process that precedes that.  What that entails, is having great communication between you and a client.  It seems easy, but being responsive is something that I feel is extremely important, yet some people just forget about.</p>
        <p>Communication plays a big part in completing a successful project.  Establishing a clear cut end goal along with milestones is essential.  It is important to receive feedback at the end of each milestone to make sure the path being taken is still leading to what both the customer/client and I have in mind. </p>
